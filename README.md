# Markov-Decision-Processes

Extend the given code (Valeu Iteration) to implement and compare algorithms:  
 * Value Iteration  
 * Policy Iteration  
 * Modified Policy Iteration algorithms   
1. Compare (plot convergence speed results)
2. Extend the examoke to add more actions (robot can execute move backward action too)
    and run the same algorithms to plot cnovergence speed.
