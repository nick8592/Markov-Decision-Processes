# Markov-Decision-Processes

Extend the given code (Valeu Iteration) to implement and compare algorithms:
Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, and Modified Policy Iteration algorithms.
A) Compare (plot convergence speed results)
B) Extend the examoke to add more actions(robot can execute move backward action too) \
and run the same algorithms to plot cnovergence speed.
